### Management
Management is the process by which organizational goals are achieved by using resources. The level of productivity, or success, depends on the performance of managerial responsibilities: planning, organizing, directing, and controlling.

To perform their managerial functions, managers must engage in the continuous process of making decisions; selecting the best alternative from two or more solutions.

### 4 Steps in Decision Making
1. Define the problem
2. Construct a model that describes the real-world problem
3. Identify possible solutions
4. Compare, choose, and recommend a potential solution to the problem

### 10 Major Categories of Managerial Roles
1. Interpersonal - motivating and engaging subordinates
2. Informational - seeks and receives a wide variety of information and transmits it to others
3. Decisional - allocates organizations resources, initiates improvement projects to bring about change

### IS for Decision Making
1. Information systems and store and process enormous amounts of data.
2. Group collaboration remotely, experts can be brought in more easily
3. Improved data management - data can be accessed quickly, economically, and securely with information systems

### Early Framework For Computerized Decision Support

**Decision support matrix**
1. Structured problems - procedures are already well established, accounting, budget analysis, financial management
2. Semistructured - inventory control, credit evaluation, building a new plant
3. Unstructured - buying software, approving loans, negotiating	, research and development

**Operational control**: the efficient and effective execution of specific tasks.

**Managerial control**: the acquisition and efficient use of resources in the accomplishment of organizational goals.

**Strategic planning**: defining long-range goals and policies for resource allocation.

Computers can automate structured decisions.

Computers can assist human judgement for semi-structured decisions.

Custom computer solutions may partially support unstructured decisions.

### Decision Support Systems (DSS)

DSS is interactive computer-based systems that help decision makers utilized dat and models to solve unstructured problems.

Basically, any system that uses technology in the support of decision making.


### A Framework for Business Intelligence (BI)

Business Intelligence (BI) is an “umbrella” term used to describe the architecture, tools, databases, analytical tools, applications and methodologies that enable interactive access to data, data manipulation, and the ability to conduct appropriate analyses to make valuable insights and better, more informed decisions.

**Executive information systems**, emerged in the 1980s, that expanded computerized support to top-level managers and executives. This would later evolve into BI, which would later include artificial intelligence, and so on.

**Four Major Components**
- Data warehouse, source data
- Business analytics, tools for manipulating, mining, and analyzing data
- Business performance management, monitoring/analyzing performance
- User interface, the dashboard

### DSS vs. BI

1. DSS may not have a data warehouse
2. DSS more directly supports specific decisions where BI is more geared at providing accurate and timely information for indirect support
3. DSS is oriented towards analysts where BI is targeting executive and strategy level decisions
4. DSS more covers unstructured problems with custom solutions where BI uses commercially available tools
5. DSS methodologies were derived from academic world where BI was mostly developed by industry
6. Some tools like data mining and predictive analysis exist in both worlds

### Business Analytics

**Analytics**: the combination of computer technology, management science techniques, and statistics to solve real problems.

**Descriptive Analytics**: also called reporting analytics refers to knowing what is happening in the organization and understanding some underlying trends and causes of such occurrences.

**Predictive Analytics**: aims to determine what is likely to happen in the future.

**Prescriptive Analytics**: recognize what is going on as well as the likely forecast and make decisions to achieve the best performance possible.
