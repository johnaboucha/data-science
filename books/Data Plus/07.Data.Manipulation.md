# Data Manipulation

- Process of recording data so it's better for processing, correlation, analysis, and reporting

## Recoding Data

- Transforming data from one form to another
- Numerical, may transform age 16 to '10 - 20' category
- Categorical, may need to standardize data coming in from surveys, like "Fart County" to just plain "Fart"
- Either replace original data or create a new column
    - SELECT address, REPLACE(address, 'St', 'Street') AS new_address

## Derived Variables

- A new variable resulting from a calculation on an existing variable
    - like when creating a new column to record difference in days between start and end dates
- Optimize for Speed, store derived variables instead of recomputing them each time
- Optimize for Space, store the formula used to calculate new variables

## Data Merge

- Combining multiple datasets into a single dataset
- Improves data by adding new variable to your existing data

## Data Blending

- Combines multiple sources of data into a single dataset at the reporting or visualization layer
    - in an ad hoc manner, no scheduling
    - does not persist over time

## Concatenation

- Merging separate variables into a single variable
    - like when time or address components are stored in separate columns

## Imputation

- Replacing missing values with substitutes
    - with an educated, best guess, estimate
    - with an average of existing values and filling it in
    - with the most common (mode)
    - with zeros
- Need to be careful and transparent on methods used

## Reduction

- Shrinking the dataset into something more manageable
- Dimension Reduction, remove attributes (columns) that you don't need
- Numerosity Reduction, reduces the number of rows
    - creating a histogram, like when analyzing people's height or weight
    - sampling, reduces data size by randomly selecting samples from the original, larger dataset
    - Do it in a way that does not introduce bias
    - Simple, just randomly selecting values
    - Stratified, creating subcategories and randomly selecting from those

## Aggregation

- The summarization of raw data
    - like census data by zip code, or estimating remaining mileage to empty
    - can also control privacy when looking at payroll information
    - can make the data easier to work with

## Normalization

- Converts data of different scales into the same one

## String Manipulation

- Cutting, combining, trimming, and other techniques used to work with text

## Data Masking

- Hides personal or sensitive data, like credit card or SSN numbers
- Either not show the data or mask it with an index field
- Index Field, a unique, non-personally identifiable number that can be used as a unique identifier

## Transposition

- Turning rows into columns and vice versa
- Pivoting data from a wide, easy-to-read format back into its original rows
- Sometimes called un-pivoting data

## Appending Data

- Combining data from one dataset to another
- Inline Append, combines data sets together
    - discards original data set
- Intermediate Append, retains individual data sets and creates a new data set with combined data
    - keeps original data
