# Inferential Statistical Methods

- The use of statistical methods to try and reach conclusions that extend beyond the immediate data

## T-Tests and P-Values

- Compares two groups to determine if there is a significant difference between their means
    - Dependent variable, the variable being measured when you're comparing the two groups, like test score when comparing two groups of students
    - Independent Variable, the variable that is different, like the number of practice exams taken between each group
- Statistical Significance, helps determine if the result happened by chance or because of the independent variable
- P Value, shows the probability that an observed difference occurred by chance
    - should be less than 0.5, or 5%, to show significance

## Hypothesis Testing

- Null Hypothesis, assumes that there is no relationship between the two variables being tested
- Alternative Hypothesis, assumes that there is a relationship between the two variables being tested
- Type I Error, occurs when the correct (null) hypothesis gets rejected and the incorrect hypothesis gets accepted
    - Creates false positives
- Type II Error, occurs when the incorrect hypothesis gets accepted and the correct hypothesis gets rejected

## Chi-Square

- Compares the size of the difference between the expected result and the actual result
- Chi-Square Test, produces the chi-square statistic and determines if a difference exists between two groups
    - to compare the actual results to what was expected to see if they're far off
    - rule out any observations that might have happened by chance instead of a causation effect
    - identify confidence in the results
    - useful when analyzing data from a random sample
    - Test of Independence, tests against multiple variables
    - Goodness of Fit, tests against a baseline

## Regression Analysis

- Statistical method used to estimate relationships between a dependent variable and one **or more** independent variables
- Often shown as a scatterplot with a line overlaid on top

## Correlation

- The relationship between two or more equal variables
- Correlation does not mean causation
- Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (R-Value), used to measure the linear relationship between data points
    - values between -1 and 1
- RÂ² Value, squared R value which is then turned into a percentile. For example, a strong correlation of 0.9 squared is 81%
