# Data Quality

## Quality Checks

- Data Validation, checks format and structure of the data
- Data Verification, checks the accuracy of the data
- Sources of Error
    - Data Transfer, when transferring data between systems
    - Human Error, like typos
    - Incorrect Data Joining
    - Data Transformations
    - Data Manipulations, when manually modifying data
    - Mergers and Acquisitions, when combining different formats
    
## Quality Dimensions

- Data Completeness, not missing data
- Data Accuracy, data is correct
- Data Consistency, data format is consistent

## Quality Rules and Metrics

- Organizations have different requirements for the data they work with
- Metrics, like how a mailing address might not require a person's name as long as the address is correct
- Rules, like how states may be recorded as "MN" instead of "Minnesota" depending on the rules of the business

## Data Validation

- Data Profiling, checking results against the expectations
- Cross Validation, checking or comparing data between two systems
- Peer Review, having another person check the data/analysis
- Data Audits, formal data governance

## Automated Validation

- Field Level Data, make sure actual data is correct
- Record Count, compare the record counts with data to ensure they match
- Calculations, verify the tools used to create calculations
    - the output of calculation
    - formula and equation are correct
- Report Visuals, double check graphs, captions, and columns
- Avoid visual inconsistencies in the visual reports

## Master Data Management

- Master Data, golden record or the master file for dimensional data types
- Master Data Management, refers to how we maintain the master data
- Reltio or Informatica are software packages that can be used for this
- Master Data Management is the process of normalizing data before it enters the data warehouse
- Master Data Management and data governance go hand in hand
    - compliance with regulations and mandates
    - enforcing data integrity and data quality
    - streamlining the access to data
    - automatically populating datasets consistently

## Streamlining Data

- Consolidation of multiple fields, to fill in gaps in data via two different systems
- Field standardization, process of standardizing records, like names, states, country abbreviations and such
- Data Dictionary, a record of what is in the master data management
    - provides quick access to available data and how it relates to other data in the organization
