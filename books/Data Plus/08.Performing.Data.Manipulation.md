# Performing Data Manipulation

- Process of changing information to make it more organized and readable

## Data Blending

- Takes data and uses different text-based functions to determine how it will be displayed or stored inside a data environment
- These text-based functions could include:
    - Trim, remove white space
    - Clean, remove non-printable characters
    - Left, Right, Mid
    - Concatenate
    - Len
    - Upper, Lower, Capitalize
    
## Parsing Strings

- Most text is unstructured
- Delimiters, characters that can be used to split data, like spaces, commas, periods, pipes, or tabs
    - The power of delimiters is limited to the source data
    
## Date Manipulation

- MONTH, returns a number, 1-12, designating month of year

## Conditional Logic

    - IF, uses logical test to see whether a condition is True or False
    - ISNULL, returns a specific value if expression is null
    - AND, tests if two conditions are True
    - OR, tests if either condition is True

## Aggregation Functions

- Combing and grouping data a certain way
- Most common:
    - SUM, sums all records in a column to create a total
    - COUNT, returns the total count of individual rows in a column
    - DISTINCT COUNT, returns count of unique values
    - AVERAGE, sums records then divides by count
    - MAX, returns maximum value in column
    - MIN, returns minimum value in column
    
## System Functions

- Any function that is packaged with your reporting or analytics software that does a specific thing within that software
    - Tools are often used to automate processes and help you save time
