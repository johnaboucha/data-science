# Data Acquisition

- Data System, any I.T. system that captures, processes, stores, queries, or reports on the data it contains
- ETL, extract, transform, load
    - the process of moving data from a source system to a data warehouse by extracting data from the source, transforming data, then loading it to the warehouse
- ELT, extract, load, transform
    - more modern method used to prepare data for data lakes by holding data in preparation for future transformation
	
## Extracting Data

- Process of extracting source data and importing it into the system
- The object is to connect to the data source
- Tools like SQL, PowerBI, and PowerQuery can extract data from external sources
	
## Transforming Data

- Process of transforming data to fit your system or another table format
- For example, transforming timestamp data to a more readable format
- Can also mean cleaning data or making cosmetic changes for convenient analysis

## Loading Data

- Process of loading data from a source system in a data warehouse
- Full Load, loads all the data
- Delta Load, loads only the new or changed data

## Application Programming Interface (API)

- Provides connection between computers and other programs on web servers
- Designed to present a set of questions and define answers in the system
- Pull Model, continuously pull data into the system, like daily or hourly
- Push Model, only sends notifications when data changes
- Web Service
    - Provides communication between or among electronic devices
	- JSON is often used, but sometimes XML too
	- Synchronous, must wait for the response for requests to the web service
	- Asynchronous, allows you to do other tasks while waiting for the response
	- Typically built for a single purpose
	
## Web Scraping

- Extracting data from a website, like through the HTML source code
- Tools like Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Scrapy are helpful
- Tends to be fragile, websites change so your web scraper needs to be updated often
- Legality issues, websites' terms of service often restrict scraping so permission is needed

## Machine Data

- The data being generated by the machine
    - Web server logs, for example
	- HVAC machines that generate data for predictive maintenance
	- Internet of Things (IOT), generating data with sensors

## Public Databases 

- Data can come the government or private/educational agencies that share data
- Do not include personal information in public data
- Aggregated Data, information that has already been summarized or compiled, like census data
- Data.gov, hosts various federal agency data under the OPEN Government Data Act
- Census.gov, contains census data in Excel and CSV files with APIs also available
- Data.Commerce.Gov, information about the economy, population, and environment
- Pew Research Center, survey data
- Kaggle.com, a wide range of data sets, often used for machine learning

## Survey Data

- Always try to avoid bias in surveys
- Types of answers may not be broad enough to cover the range of options
- Single Choice
    - Shades of grey cannot fit into Yes/No questions
	- May not be the right type of survey
- Multiple Choice
    - Make sure choices cover the entire range of possibilities
- Likert Scale, a rating scale of responses
- Text-Based Response, allows people to share reactions in the form of writing
    - "Your Feedback Matters"

## Sampling and Observation

- Observation, collecting data by observing and then analyzing afterward
    - should not be manipulated
- Sampling, creating a smaller data set from a larger one
    - Random, selecting data at random
	- Systemic, choosing a random starting point to begin analysis
	- Stratified, when subcategories should be represented evenly
