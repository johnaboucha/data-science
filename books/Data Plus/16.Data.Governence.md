# Data Governance

- Term used to describe the capability of an organization to ensure that high quality data exists through the complete lifecycle of the data and that data controls are implemented to support business objectives
    - Access
    - Retention
    - Processing
    - Security
    
## Data Lifecycle

- Period of time the data exists in the system
- Data Creation, when data is acquired, entered, or captured into the system
    - Data Acquisition, when existing data produced outside and is imported automatically into the system
    - Data Entry, when data is manually entered into the system
    - Data Capture, occurs when a device is generating data
- Data Storage, occurs when data is not being actively used
    - needs to be protected by the permissions of its users
- Data Use, viewing, processing, modifying, manipulating, or saving the data
- Data Archival, copying and storing data that can be used when needed, like backups
    - takes longer to access
- Data Destruction, when data is no longer useful, destroy it
- When writing data governance policies, consider the data lifecycle

## Data Roles

- Stakeholders can provide the proper classification for the data belonging to an organization
    - public, private, sensitive, confidential
- Data Owner, the person responsible for the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of information
- Data Steward, person who ensures data is properly labeled, identified, collected, and stored â€” focused on quality of data
- Data Custodian, person who manages the system on which the data assets are stored
- Privacy Officer, person who provides oversight of any kind for privacy-related data
    - ensures organization follows proper data minimization, data sovereignty, data retention, and data destruction
    
## Regulations and Compliance

- Regulations, rules implemented by an authority and backed by law
- Compliance, shows that an organization meets the requirements for a given regulation
- Data Sovereignty, jurisdictional control or legal authority on collected or stored data that may be imposed by countries and states
    - Europe versus U.S., like data privacy (GDPR)
    - Rules surrounding data sovereignty change all the time
    
## Data Classification

- A way to categorize or classify data based on value and sensitivity
    - Public, front-facing websites
    - Sensitive, financial information
    - Private, personnel records
    - Confidential, intellectual property
- Government Classification
    - Unclassified, public websites
    - Controlled Unclassified, medical records
    - Confidential, trade secrets
    - Secret, military plans
    - Top Secret, weapon blueprints
- Data Type, tag or label that's used to identify a piece of data under a subcategory of a classification
    - personally identifiable information, like name, birthday, SSN
    - protected health information, protected by HIPPA
    - personally identifiable financial information, bank account number
    - intellectual property, copyright and trademark material
    
## Access Requirements

- Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), defines what data is considered confidential and cannot be shared outside the relationship
- Acceptable Use Agreement, describes how data can be used and for what purposes
- Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), a gentlemen's agreement, a non-binding letter of intent between two or more organizations to detail the rules, roles, and expectations for both parties

## Data Retention

- Maintains the existence and control of data to comply with business policies and/or applicable laws and regulations
- Consult with legal counsel when developing data retention policies
- Data Preservation, keeps data for a specific purpose outside of the data retention policy
- Data Removal, any process that deletes data (trash bin) or makes it inaccessible
    - okay for least sensitive data
- Data Destruction, deletes data and tries to destroy underlying data
- Data Sanitization, performs verification function to ensure data has been permanently destroyed
    - could include physical destruction of data
    
## Data Processing

- Occurs when data is collected and translated into usable information
- Transactional Processing, used for large volumes of information that is process synchronously
- Distributed Processing, takes large volumes of datasets and distributes them to multiple servers
- Real-Time Processing, provides real-time output that can change things in the middle of the process, like GPS routing on phone or in car
- Batch Processing, process large amounts of data in batches
- Multiprocessing, uses multiple processors to work on the same dataset

## Data Security

- Data Encryption, process that uses algorithms to scramble data into another form called a ciphertext
- Encryption Key, used to decrypt ciphertext
- Data at Rest, data being stored in a ciphertext
    - needs to be encrypted before stored again
- Data in Transit, data that is transferred or stored in another system
- Data in Use, data that is currently being processed
- Data at Rest, In Use, and In Transit can be protected with encryption
- De-Identification, removing fields that could be used to identify an individual from a dataset
- Data Masking, used to minimize the amount of data shared by limiting the information shown in the system
- Data Breach, occurs when information is read, modified, or deleted without proper authorization


## Data Access

- Focused on permissions to access data given data governance policies
- Read/Write Permissions, access to read and write the data
- Role-Based Permissions, access assigned to the user based on their "job function"
- User Group Permissions, access given to people based on their group affiliation

## Data Storage

- Shared Drive, network hard drives that can be accessed within the organization
- Cloud Drive, externally shareable drive stored on a cloud server
    - OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox
- Local Storage, the machine's internal drive or locally attached external drive
- think about who needs access to the data and how backups will occur

## Entity Relationships

- Provide an overview of the different systems that have data
- Conceptual Data Model, shows where data exists and how that data relates to other data in the system
    - high level overview
- Logical Data Model, shows a more detailed view that includes data fields and the relationships between them
- Physical Data Model, shows actual data systems with tables, relationships, fields, and attributes
- Entity Relationship Diagram, pictorial representation of data, its fields and relationships
- Record Linkages, identify records corresponding to matching or merging records that go between different data sets, but are all linked together
- Record Link Restriction, prevents protected datasets from combining with other data sets
- Data Constraint, integrity rules that limit the types of data that can go into a column or table in the database
- Data Integrity, existence of accurate and consistent data in a database
    - Domain Integrity, accepted field values
    - Entity Integrity, unique record identifier
    - Referential Integrity, data integrity between tables
    - User-Defined Integrity, based on own business rules
