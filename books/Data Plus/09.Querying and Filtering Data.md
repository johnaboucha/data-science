# Querying and Filtering Data

## Querying Data

- The request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables

## Join Types

- Inner Join, is the most common, when combining A and B, returns the intersection where the shared ID matches
- Left Outer Join, when querying A and B, returns A and the intersection of A and B
- Right Outer Join, same as Left Join but in reverse
- Full Outer Join, returns all query records in A and B
- Cross Outer Join, a Cartesian multiplication of all values in A and B, returns a very large dataset

## Filtering Data

- Restricts query to a certain subset of values in the source data
- Filter by date, numerical, or other values
    - In SQL, this could be done with a "WHERE" clause
- Filters can be used to optimize query performance

## Parameterization

- Concept of replacing values in the query with parameters (or variables)
- Makes it easier to run and rerun the same query with different values

## Indexing Data

- Helps speed up queries on a given column within a table
- They do take up extra space in the database though

## Temporary Tables

- A table that only resides in memory, created from some initial query
- Contains less data than the original so:
    - Executes much faster
    - Useful for organization purposes, to break down complicated queries in steps

## Subsets of Records

- Subquery (Nested Query), query nested inside of another
    - Read from the inside-out
    
## Query Execution Plan

- Sometimes called the "Execution Plan"
- Visual representation that provides details about how the query executes
- You may find things that aren't necessary in the query when studying the query execution plan
- Actual Execution Plan, use to confirm the computational resources that were used on the data set
