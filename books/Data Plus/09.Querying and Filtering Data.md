# Querying and Filtering Data

## Querying Data

- The request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables
- Data Definition Language (DDL), components of SQL
    - Create, Modify, and Delete tables and associative objects
    - Manages the structure of the database
- Data Manipulation Language (DML), components of SQL
    - Insert, Modify, and Retrieve information from databases
    - Manages the data in the database
    - CRUD, create, read, update, delete
- Indicator Flag, uses an extra column to simplify query structure, like start and end dates

## Join Types

- Inner Join, is the most common, when combining A and B, returns the intersection where the shared ID matches
- Left Outer Join, when querying A and B, returns A and the intersection of A and B
- Right Outer Join, same as Left Join but in reverse
- Full Outer Join, returns all query records in A and B
- Cross Outer Join, a Cartesian multiplication of all values in A and B, returns a very large dataset

## Filtering

- A way to reduce the data down to only the rows you need
    - in SQL, this is the WHERE clause
    - combine with logical operators: AND, OR
- Filter by date, numerical, or other values
    - In SQL, this could be done with a "WHERE" clause
- Filters can be used to optimize query performance
- IFF, logical function: SELECT name, IFF(Sex = 'M', 'Male', 'Female')

## Sorting

- Specifying order of the query results
- SQL, uses the ORDER BY clause, followed by ASC or DESC keywords

## Aggregate Functions

- Summarizes data
- Common aggregation in SQL:
    - COUNT
    - MIN
    - MAX
    - AVG
    - SUM
    - STDDEV

## Parameterization

- Reduces the number of times the database has to parse individual queries
- Concept of replacing values in the query with parameters (or variables)
- Makes it easier to run and rerun the same query with different values
- Prevents SQL Injection attacks
    - SELECT * FROM Students WHERE name=? ORDER BY name

## Indexing Data

- Full Table Scan, when the database has to scan each row
- Database Index, helps speed up queries on a given column within a table
- They do take up extra space in the database though
- Faster read, slower create, update, delete activity
- Creates pointers where data is stored within a database

## Temporary Tables

- A table that only resides in memory, created from some initial query
- Contains less data than the original so:
    - Executes much faster
    - Useful for organization purposes, to break down complicated queries in steps

## Subsets of Records

- Subquery (Nested Query), query nested inside of another
    - Read from the inside-out

## Query Execution Plan

- Sometimes called the "Execution Plan"
- Integral part of building efficient queries
- Visual representation that provides details about how the query executes
- You may find things that aren't necessary in the query when studying the query execution plan
- Actual Execution Plan, use to confirm the computational resources that were used on the data set
