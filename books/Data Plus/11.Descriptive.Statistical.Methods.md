# Descriptive Statistical Methods

- Numbers that summarize data, such as the mean, standard deviation, percentages, rates, counts, and range

## Central Tendency

- Finding the center of the data
    - Mean, the average of the data, susceptible to outliers
    - Median, sort the values and take the midpoint, less susceptible to outliers
    - Mode, most common value in data, more useful for categorical data but can work with numbers, like most common number of children in a household
    
## Dispersion

- Min, the smallest value
- Max, the largest value
- Range, the difference between the largest and smallest value

## Standard Deviation

- How dispersed the data is relative to the mean
- Variance (σ2), the average of the squared differences from the mean
- Standard Deviation (σ), the square root of the variance
    - usually used to identify outliers
    - data points more than 1 standard deviation from the mean can be considered unusual
- Population (σ2), the entire data set, divide by *n*
- Sample, part of the data set, divide by *n - 1*

$$ S = \sqrt{(x - \bar(x)) /over n - 1}
