# Descriptive Statistical Methods

- Numbers that summarize data, such as the mean, standard deviation, percentages, rates, counts, and range

## Central Tendency

- Finding the center of the data
    - Mean, the average of the data, susceptible to outliers
    - Median, sort the values and take the midpoint, less susceptible to outliers
    - Mode, most common value in data, more useful for categorical data but can work with numbers, like most common number of children in a household

## Dispersion

- Min, the smallest value
- Max, the largest value
- Range, the difference between the largest and smallest value
    - would effectively show the extreme cases of variability

## Standard Deviation

- How dispersed the data is relative to the mean
    - STD can be used to measure market volatility and predict performance trends
- Variance (σ2), the average of the squared differences from the mean
    - = sum(x - x̄)²/ n, or (n - 1) if it's sample variance
- Standard Deviation (σ), the square root of the variance
    - usually used to identify outliers
    - data points more than 1 standard deviation from the mean can be considered unusual
- Population (σ2) Variance, the entire data set, divide by *n*
- Sample Variance, part of the data set, divide by *n - 1*

$$S = \sqrt{\frac{x-\bar{x}}{n-1}}$$

## Z Score

- How many standard deviations away from the mean a value is.
- Calculated by subtracting the mean from the value and dividing by the standard deviation

$$Z = \frac{x-μ}{S}$$

- Z = standard score
- x = observed value
- μ = mean of the sample
- S = standard deviation of the sample

## Distribution

- Normal distribution, a.k.a. the Bell Curve, displays the probability versus the standard deviation where values exist
- Empirical Rule, tendency of most data points to fall within three standard deviations of the mean
    - 1 STD, 68.2%
    - 2 STD, 95.44%
    - 3 STD, 99.74%
- Parametric Data, data set with at least 99.74% of values falling within three standard deviations
- Nonparametric Data, not a normal distribution, like 1-5 star rating
- Skew, the deviation from a perfect distribution, more data on one side of the mean than the other

## Frequency

- Number of times the same data appears in a data set
- Often visualized in a histogram plot
- Frequency Percent, percentage that value occurs relative to the entire dataset

## Percentages

- Percentage Difference, the absolute difference between two numbers, divided by their mean, multiplied by 100
    - always positive
- Percentage Change, the change from one point to the next in a sequence
    - difference between two numbers, divided by the second, multiplied by 100
    - can either be positive or negative

## Confidence Interval

- The range (min - max) of values within the confidence level
    - typical confidence level used is 95%
    - to find confidence in Excel:
        - =CONFIDENCE(0.05, STDEV(A2:A11), 10)
    - min is mean - confidence
    - max is mean + confidence
