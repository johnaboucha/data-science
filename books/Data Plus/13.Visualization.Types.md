# Visualization Types

- The graphical representation of information and data

## Pie Chart

- Good for showing percentage of a whole
- Group things together for easy digestion of information
- Better for broad categories

## Tree Map

- Made for representing hierarchical information
- Easy reading with just the large categories labeled
- Better for hierarchical subcategories

## Column and Bar Charts

- Bar Chart, values are on the x-axis
- Column Chart, values are on the y-axis
    - Better for ordinal categorical data, like reading from left to right, showing trends
	- Good for time-based data as well, though line charts are even better for non-categorical data
	
## Line Chart

- Typically used to show time-based data
- Markers, the dots or symbols on each data point

## Combining Charts

- Stacking information together into more complex visualizations
- Stacked Column Chart, for example, can show column data, plus an average or trend line as well
- Two axes with different scales may be needed

## Scatter Plot and Bubble Chart

- Scatter Plot, show two numerical values
    - good at showing relationships and outliers in the data
- Bubble Charts, can display a third dimension on top of a scatter plot by adjusting the size of the dots

## Histogram

- Shows the distribution and frequency of information grouped into bins
- The bins have no spaces in between them, unlike the column chart
- The bins are all the same size and not too many of them, less than 20
- Make sure to include outliers in the bins

## Waterfall

- Shows the performance or discrete events over time
- Like the Network performance tab in the Chrome Developer Tools
- Can be horizontal or vertical
