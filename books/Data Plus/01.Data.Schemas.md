# Data Schemas

Data Schema: an abstract design that represents the storage of data in a database.

**Relational Databases**
- also called 'tabular schema' because of its rows/columns format
- RDBMS, relational database management system, used in different database software like MySQL, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora
- SQL, structured query language is used to query managed data within relational databases
- - used across all relational databases
- Relational databases are built using tables that are linked by a common field to store data

**Non-Relational Databases**
- not based on relationships, known as NoSQL
- handles extremely large amounts of data and traffic
- Types
- - Document-orientated, uses XML or JSON to store data
- - Key-value store, 2-column, key-based storage
- - Column-orientated, stores data in columns instead of rows, analyses are sometimes easier
- - Graph store - stores individual elements as nodes in database, more complicated but scales better, uses GraphQL
