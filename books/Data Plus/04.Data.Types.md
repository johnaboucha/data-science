# Data Types

## Categories of Data

- Quantitative, data that is portrayed with numbers
    - Discrete, is countable and will have a limited number of values
	- Continuous, is measurable and can use any value
- Qualitative, data that is subjective and is defined by the qualities of the data itself
    - Nominal, has no natural order, like favorite color
	- Ordinal, follows a natural order, like survey results ("agree", "strongly agree")
	- always discrete

## Data Element/Field Types

- Character, a single character or number
- Alphanumeric, most common data type, holding character-based data
    - storing SKUs
- Text, a series of characters, subset of alphanumeric, excludes numbers
    - common encoding format is UTF-8
- Date, a calendar object that can include time
- Number, numeric values, can undergo mathematical operations, and can be stored as different types (float, int)
- Currency, a special data type that would include two decimal places
    - alternatively, also store as Numeric
- Boolean, True or False, 0 or 1, can be used with logical operations

## Converting Data

- Data can be converted to different data types as needed

## Data Structures

- Structured Data, follows an existing convention, specific fields already in the database
    - data that fits nicely and cleanly into clearly defined tables and databases
	- spreadsheets
	- data is consistent
- Unstructured Data, not organized in a predefined manner
    - data that could be anything
	    - images
		- audio
		- video
		- large text, differentiated from 'text' by size
		- machine data, IoT devices, log files
	- stored as a Blob (Microsoft Azure) or Bucket (AWS S3) for example
	    - as binary data, most common
- Semi-Structured Data, a mixture of both structured and unstructured data
    - html
	- email

## Data File Formats

- Delimited File, uses some character to separate each field of data
    - Commas in comma separated values (.CSV) file
	    - can be structured or semi-structured
	- Tabs in a tab delimited (.TAB or .TSV) file
	- Or anything else in .TXT files
- Flat File, any delimited file exported out of a database system that can be shared with others
    - often used to back up data or to get a snap-shot of the database

## Data Languages

- SQL, structured query language
    - most common language when interacting with a database
    - consists of statements, such as:
	- ```
		SELECT StudentID, FirstName, LastName
		FROM Student.Table
		WHERE LastName = 'Dion'
		ORDERBY LastName, FirstName
	```
- HTML, hypertext markup language
    - semi-structured data for displaying web pages
	- allows for web scraping
- XML, eXtensible Markup Language
    - used to transfer data between data systems
	- any element and structure possible
- JSON, javascript object notation
    - used to transfer data between web sites/servers
	- the 'de facto' file format when sending information across the internet
	- uses key-value pairs
