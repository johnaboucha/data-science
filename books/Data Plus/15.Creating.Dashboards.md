# Creating Dashboards

- Dashboards are used to track, analyze, and display data to gain deeper insights into the overall well being of an organization
- MOST IMPORTANT thing to consider is: your audience

## Extracting Data

- Natural Order, whatever order data was put into the database, not usually what we want
- Multi-sorting, sorting by one or more fields
- Top-end and Bottom-end Sorts, like a 'Top 10' list
    - this is first a sorting operation, then a filtering one
- Custom Sort, something you define yourself
- Filtering:
    - Hardcoded Filters, can't change filters, okay if end user doesn't need to see anything else
    - Interactive Filters, select different options to filter by to dynamically explore the data more deeply
    - Visual Filters, like when maps are used as the filtering tool
    - Date Filters, filtering by date ranges, years, quarters, months, etc...

## Data Tables

- Shows different variations of how data is represented

## Dashboard Design

- Organizations will often have style guides that should be adhered to
- Don't pick colors at random
- Make sure styles, colors, fonts, etc. are consistent throughout

## Documenting Dashboards

- Renaming fields and labels to something more readable
    - change the query
    - use transformation step
- Make sure the text in captions, page titles, legends is clear

## Documentation Elements

- Version Number, to know what version people are looking at
    - include what changes are made for each version
- Report Header, appears on the first page at the very top of the report that would include the title and version number
- Page Header, appears on the top of every page, may include field headings
- Page Footer, appears on the bottom of every page, may include summary information or credits to the report writers
- Refresh Date, date report was last updated
- Print Date, date the report was printed
- Watermark, useful for Confidential or Final Draft, so it's clear to users that restrictions exist

## Report Elements

- Cover Page, high level summaries
    - Title
    - Summary, includes executive summary, goals of the report
    - Key Findings, main takeaways
    - Significance, final conclusions or whether more research needed
- Instructions, if the report has a dashboard, include instructions on how to use it
- FAQ, question and answer format for commonly asked questions about the data
- Appendix, includes additional details and more tables

## Dashboard Optimization

- Art of keeping the dashboard simple and concise
- Visual Filter, can expand and collapse information on the dashboard
- Drillthrough, allows users to drill down into more specific information, maybe through filters and such
- Tooltips, hover over specific data points to see more information in a little popup
    - Power BI and Tableau can create complex tooltips
- Other optimizations:
    - How often dashboard should update?
    - Security features may impact speed
    - Speed in which the report is generated

## Deploying Dashboards

- Make sure instructions and documentation is prepared
- Make sure labels and names are clear and correct
- Test dashboard thoroughly
- Check all approvals and permissions
- Make sure all software tools used are licensed appropriately
