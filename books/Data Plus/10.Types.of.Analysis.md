# Types of Analysis

## Determining the Analysis Type

- Research questions should be specific enough to easily identify the answer
- Hypothesis Statement, introduces a research question and will be tested by research
- Question to consider:
    1. What is the source of the data?
    2. Does this data come from a system that's easy to collect and observe data?
    3. Will we collect data through polling, surveys, or asking people individually?
- Observation, uses a smaller sample size instead of collecting all the data

## Exploratory Analysis

- Goal is to figure out what type of cleaning, profiling, and transformation the data needs
- The initial look at the dataset when you first begin your analysis

## Performance Analysis

- Measures the performance of a particular product, outcome, or scenario against the defined objective
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), measurements and goals that help identify whether a business is achieving its objectives
    - Qualitative
    - Quantitative
    - Establish KPIs that are realistic and that can be met
    
## Gap Analysis

- Analyzes the difference between the present state and the desired future state
- Scope, measurable goals to meet desired end state
- Delta, change between where you are and where you want to be

## Trend Analysis

- Measures the trend on historical data to predict a future outcome
    - Market Research
    - Strategic Initiatives
    - Company Expenses
    - Revenue
- Trends happen over Short Term and Long Term time periods

## Link Analysis

- Determine how a single data point links to other data points
    - Network, all the nodes and links in the analysis
    - Node, single person, account, or product
    - Link, the relationship between the nodes
- Figure out which links will help in achieving your desired outcome
