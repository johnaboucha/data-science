# Data Schemas

Data Schema: an abstract design that represents the storage of data in a database.

**Relational Databases**
- also called 'tabular schema' because of its rows/columns format
- RDBMS, relational database management system, used in different database software like MySQL, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora
- SQL, structured query language is used to query managed data within relational databases
    - used across all relational databases
- Relational databases are built using tables that are linked by a common field to store data

**Non-Relational Databases**
- not based on relationships, known as NoSQL
- handles extremely large amounts of data and traffic
- Types
    - Document-orientated, uses XML or JSON to store data
    - Key-value store, 2-column, key-based storage
    - Column-orientated, stores data in columns instead of rows, analyses are sometimes easier
    - Graph store - stores individual elements as nodes in database, more complicated but scales better, uses GraphQL
	
**Relational vs. Non-Relational**
Relational
- Normalization techniques needed to design tables with the least amount of information
- Transaction - writing data to the database
- Querying - reading data from the database
- Relational databases are very specific as to what can be stored in each field
Non-Relational
- Much more flexible and don't require as much planning
- Works with any programming language, not just SQL
- Stores both structured and non-structured data

**Data Normalization**
- Optimization of storage and use of data in the database
- Different orders of magnitude: First - Fifth; 1NF - 5NF
- First three are most common
- Generally, separating related information into its own table (2NF) is good form

**Database Relationships**
- Primary key - unique identifier for each database entry/row
- Foreign key - the primary key of another table
- Relationships
    - 1 to 1: one record can only be associated with one record in another table
	- 1 to many: one record can be associated with many records in another table
	- many to many: many records are associated with many records in different tables
	
**Referential Integrity**
- used to establish and maintain relationships in the database
- used to make sure keys exist before we start making records
- Changes to the database must be cascaded through update or deletion to ensure data is not orphaned or made inconsistent

**Data Denormalization**
- Occurs when the data is not structured in tables using normalization
