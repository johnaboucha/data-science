# Data Schemas

- Data Schema: an abstract design that represents the storage of data in a database.
- Entity Relationship Diagram, visual diagram showing connections between related entities (tables)
- Cardinality, shows how many instances of one entity relate to instances of another
    - Unary Relationship, when an entity has a relationship with itself, like employee <> manager
    - Binary Relationship, connects two entities, most common
    - Ternary Relationship, connects three entities

**Relational Databases**
- also called 'tabular schema' because of its rows/columns format
- RDBMS, relational database management system, used in different database software like MySQL, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora
- SQL, structured query language is used to query managed data within relational databases
    - used across all relational databases
- Relational databases are built using tables that are linked by a common field to store data

**Non-Relational Databases**
- not based on relationships, also known as NoSQL
- handles extremely large amounts of data and traffic
- Types
    - Document-orientated, uses XML or JSON to store data
    - Key-value store, 2-column, key-based storage
    - Column-family, stores data in columns instead of rows
        - main advantage is ability to scale
    - Graph store - stores individual elements as nodes in database
        - more complicated but scales better than relational DB
        - uses GraphQL
        - maps relationships between entities
        - good for a recommendation engine
	
**Relational vs. Non-Relational**
Relational
- Normalization techniques needed to design tables with the least amount of information
- Transaction - writing data to the database
- Querying - reading data from the database
- Relational databases are very specific as to what can be stored in each field
Non-Relational
- Much more flexible and don't require as much planning
- Works with any programming language, not just SQL
- Stores both structured and non-structured data

**Data Normalization**
- Structures database in a way that minimizes duplication of data
- First three are most common
    - 1NF, when every row is unique and every column has a unique value
    - 2NF, all non-primary key values must depend on a single primary key
    - 3NF, all columns must depend on only the primary key
        - considered highly normalized
- Generally, separating related information into its own table (2NF) is good form

**Database Relationships**
- Primary key - unique identifier for each database entry/row
- Foreign key - the primary key of another table
    - forces referential integrity
- Composite key - a primary key with more than one column
- Relationships
    - 1 to 1: one record can only be associated with one record in another table
	- 1 to many: one record can be associated with many records in another table
	- many to many: many records are associated with many records in different tables

**Referential Integrity**
- used to establish and maintain relationships in the database
- used to make sure keys exist before we start making records
- Changes to the database must be cascaded through update or deletion to ensure data is not orphaned or made inconsistent
- Foreign Keys are used to enforce integrity when joining tables

**Data Denormalization**
- Occurs when the data is not structured in tables using normalization
