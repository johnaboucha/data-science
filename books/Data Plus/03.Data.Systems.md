# Data Systems

- Any information technology system that captures, processes, stores, queries, or reports on data contained within it.

## Data Processing Types

- OLTP (online transactional processing)
    - designed to handle very large scale transactions
	- built for large numbers of real-time requests
- OLAP (online analytical processing)
    - designed to handler longer running queries for more complex data processing
	
## Data Warehouse

- Source System, system of record in any kind of data system
- Data Warehouse manages the data accumulated from a wide range of source systems within a company to enable and support BI and analytics across those systems
- Handles big queries with lots of joins and lots and lots of data
- Data Mart, a subset of the data to provide users access to only the data and resources they need for their work

## Data Warehouse Schemas

- Fact Table, contains all the primary/foreign keys associated with the query being done
- Dimension Table, the tables associated with the keys in the Fact Table
- Star Schema, individual dimension tables branching out from the fact table — one layer/level of tables
- Snowflake Schema, dimension tables that link out from dimension tables — multiple layers/levels of dimension tables

## Data Lakes

- Centralized repository that holds both structured and unstructured data, like Amazon S3
- Often contains raw, uncleaned data
- Data Lakehouse can be used to query data in place within the data lake

## Changing Dimensional Data

- Fact Tables changes very frequently
- Dimension Tables change very slowly
    - Type I, overwrites old data and history of changes is lost
	- Type II, creates a new row for every change to the data and retains a complete history
	- Type III, adds new columns for a limited number of changes, may keep track of a 'previous' record but not the entire history of changes
