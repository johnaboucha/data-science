# Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market

New York City (NYC) is one of the most-visited cities in the world. As a result, there are many Airbnb listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for anywhere between a few nights to many months. In the ```NYC.Airbnb.ipynb``` notebook, we will look at the NYC Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx.
